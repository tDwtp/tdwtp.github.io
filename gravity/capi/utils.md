This is a compendium for some utilities commonly used for interactions with or
for Gravity.  
Basic file/directory interactions are provided to easily expand I/O related
features or detection.  
Strings, their UTF-8 encoding and parsing strings to numbers (octal, decimal
and hexadecimals)  
Time-functions and an simple `ceil(n^2)` function is provided as well.
